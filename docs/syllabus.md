# Course Syllabus: Lifecycle of Artificial Intelligence Systems

## Course Objectives

The primary objective of this course is to equip students with an engineering mindset to understand and practically apply the complete model lifecycle management of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The curriculum spans from initial requirements and data pipelines through development and validation, all the way to operations and continuous, feedback-driven improvement. 

Built heavily upon industrial MLOps practices, the course covers reproducibility, versioning and experiment tracking, automated quality assurance (testing and evaluation), CI/CD-based deployment, observability (monitoring and drift detection), incident management, and governance.

Upon successful completion, students will be capable of independently designing and maintaining production-ready, scalable, end-to-end AI pipelines that meet modern industrial and research standards. They will also be prepared to assume various roles within the AI system lifecycle (e.g., Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, MLOps Engineer) and effectively collaborate and communicate with stakeholders across the entire process.

## Prerequisites & Audience

The course is designed for software engineering students. Expected background:

* **Programming:** Solid general programming skills and Git basics. Python is the primary language used in labs.
* **Machine Learning:** A completed introductory ML course. We assume students have seen train/test splits, basic models, and evaluation metrics; Week 1 only briefly refreshes these. The ML used in labs is deliberately simple (Scikit-learn on tabular data) — the focus of this course is the engineering lifecycle, not modeling.
* **No prior experience assumed** with Docker, MLflow, DVC, Prefect, Kubernetes, or monitoring tooling — these are taught from scratch.

## Course Approach

* **One running example:** A single Scikit-learn pipeline predicting diabetes onset from real diagnostic data (Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, established in Week 1) is carried through the entire semester. Each week adds one lifecycle capability to the same project rather than introducing new toy problems.
* **Tutorial-first:** Labs follow the official getting-started tutorials of each tool (MLflow, DVC, Pandera, Prefect, KServe, Evidently, etc.) with minimal changes, so official documentation remains directly usable as a reference.

## Technical Requirements

Students need a laptop with Docker support and at least 16 GB RAM (later weeks run several services locally). Setup is covered in the Week 1 lab. Windows, macOS, and Linux are all supported.

## Assessment

This is a **mid-semester-grade** subject.

### Requirements during the teaching period

All three must be met — they are thresholds, not weights, and failing any one of them fails the semester:

1. **Labs — 70% completed.** Of the 13 laboratory exercises, at least **10** must be completed successfully. If exercises are cancelled because of a mid-week public holiday or teaching break, the threshold moves with the count: **12 labs → 9**, **11 labs → 8**.
2. **Homework — at least 4 of the 5** small assignments at a satisfactory level, each individually scoring **at least 50%** of its available points.
3. **Written test (ZH) — at least 50%** of the available points.

### Grade

With all three met, the mid-semester grade is:

> **Grade = 0.6 × (HF1 + HF2 + HF3 + HF4 + HF5) / 5 + 0.4 × ZH**

The homework mean includes **all five** assignments, including any that were not submitted — only four have to *pass*, but a missing fifth still enters the average as a zero.

### Retakes

| Component | Repeatable? |
| :--- | :--- |
| A missed or failed **laboratory exercise** | **No** |
| **Homework** | **One** of the five, during the retake week. |
| **ZH** | Once, during the retake week. |

### Delivery

* **Odd weeks (in person):** a practice-oriented lecture, followed by a related laboratory exercise in which students apply the new material by solving tasks independently under supervision.
* **Even weeks (online / at home, asynchronous):** students study a short theoretical summary ([`docs/notes/`](notes/)) and then complete the laboratory tasks on their own; the lab leaders evaluate the submissions.
* **Homework** is developed independently, project-style, with optional consultation.

### Project work

All five homework assignments build incrementally on a single project. The project topic (dataset + prediction task) is chosen and approved in Week 3; the canonical course dataset may be used as a fallback. See [`datasets/README.md`](../datasets/README.md) for the topic catalogue.

### Written test (ZH)

Held in the last weeks and covering lecture material from all previous weeks. The revision guide — what is examinable per week, the recurring question shapes, and worked answers — is [`docs/exam-revision.md`](exam-revision.md).

### Grade boundaries

| Score | Grade |
| :--- | :--- |
| 85–100% | 5 (jeles) |
| 70–84% | 4 (jó) |
| 55–69% | 3 (közepes) |
| 40–54% | 2 (elégséges) |
| below 40% | 1 (elégtelen) |

These convert the weighted score into a grade **only once all three requirements above are met** — the 40% pass boundary does not override the 50% component thresholds on homework and the ZH.

### AI tool policy

Use of AI assistants is permitted — this is an industry reality the course embraces. The condition is accountability: **students must understand and be able to explain every artifact they submit**.

## Assignment Deadlines Summary

**Each assignment is released on the odd (in-person) week whose lab it depends on, and is due three to four weeks later** (the last two windows are shorter, because the semester ends).

*Submissions are due by 23:59 (Budapest) on the Sunday closing the deadline week, via the student's own project repository.*

| | Released | Due | Window | What it covers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project topic** | Week 1 | **Week 3** (Sun 27 Sep) | 3 weeks | Dataset + prediction task, approved by the instructor. — [brief](../homework/project-topic/README.md) |
| **HW 1** | Week 5 (5 Oct) | **Week 8** (Sun 1 Nov) | 4 weeks | Basic MLOps project with data versioning, experiment tracking, and model management. — [brief](../homework/hw-01-data-versioning-and-tracking/README.md) |
| **HW 2** | Week 7 (19 Oct) | **Week 10** (Sun 15 Nov) | 4 weeks | Automated data validation, evaluation, and documented quality thresholds ("go/no-go"). — [brief](../homework/hw-02-validation-and-evaluation-gates/README.md) |
| **HW 3** | Week 9 (2 Nov) | **Week 12** (Sun 29 Nov) | 4 weeks | End-to-end Prefect flow with parameterization and retry handling. — [brief](../homework/hw-03-orchestration/README.md) |
| **HW 4** | Week 11 (16 Nov) | **Week 13** (Sun 6 Dec) | 3 weeks | Model serving via KServe with version handling, documented rollouts, and smoke tests. — [brief](../homework/hw-04-serving-and-rollout/README.md) |
| **HW 5** | Week 13 (30 Nov) | **Week 14** (Sun 13 Dec) | 2 weeks | Observability setup (Grafana + alerts) and drift analysis with intervention strategies. — [brief](../homework/hw-05-observability-and-drift/README.md) |

*Dates assume Week 1 begins Monday 7 September 2026; adjust with the academic calendar. HW 5 has the shortest window because the semester ends — its scope is correspondingly smaller, and it is due in the same week as the written test (ZH). One homework may be repeated in the retake week (see Assessment).*
