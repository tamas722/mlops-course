"""Experiment tracking: structured logging, parameter sweeps, and run search.

New in Week 3. Week 2 proved the tracking server works by logging ONE run with
three loose `log_param` calls. This module is the engineering upgrade:

  - batched `log_params` / `log_metrics` (one REST round-trip, not N)
  - tags, which are how you FIND runs later
  - a signature + input example, which make the logged model self-describing
  - plots logged as artifacts
  - a sweep: one parent run with one child run per grid cell
  - server-side run search, so comparison is a query and not scrolling
