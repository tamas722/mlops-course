# Pinned MLflow tracking server image.
# Installs MLflow plus the two backend dependencies:
#   - psycopg2-binary: PostgreSQL driver for the backend store
#   - boto3: AWS/S3 SDK for the artifact store (MinIO is S3-compatible)
#
# Using a dedicated Dockerfile instead of `pip install` in the compose command
# is the week's lesson about reproducible runtimes: the image is pinned,
# immutable, and reproducible across machines and CI runs.
