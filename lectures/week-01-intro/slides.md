# November 2021: a software failure with no stack trace

Zillow — one of the largest US real-estate platforms — shuts down its house-flipping business, **Zillow Offers**.

- Its pricing model (the "Zestimate" pipeline) systematically **overpaid for homes** as the market shifted
- Roughly **$300M written off in a single quarter**; ~25% of the workforce laid off
- The code had no bug. The services were up. Every request returned **HTTP 200**.

<br>

<div style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.35; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 0.5em;">
The model was wrong about the world.
</div>


---

# The dashboards were green the whole time

Classic monitoring watched: uptime ✓ latency ✓ error rate ✓

Nobody was systematically watching:

- had the input data distribution shifted since training?
- did the relationship between features and prices still hold?
- which data snapshot and which code version produced the deployed model?
- what was the rollback plan for a *statistically* failing model?

<br>

### **This course is about building the engineering systems that answer those questions.**

The same failure pattern hit credit-scoring models during COVID: inputs looked normal, predictions were wrong.

# Agenda

1. **Why do we need MLOps** — what breaks, and why DevOps alone does not fix it
2. **ML in research vs. in production** — the same model, two different jobs
3. **ML systems vs. traditional software** — where code and data stop being separable
4. **ML production myths** — six things people believe on the way in
5. **When to use ML** — and when a lookup table is the right answer
6. **The lifecycle** — the loop every ML system lives in, and where the friction shows up
7. **The three pillars** — reproducibility, scalability, automation
8. **Who does the work** — the roles around the loop
9. **The toolchain** — Git, Docker, MLflow, CI/CD
10. **In practice** — the anti-patterns, and today's lab

<!--
If you are short on time, sections 4 and 9 compress best (myths can be read from the notes,
the toolchain returns every week). Sections 2, 3 and 6 are the ones the rest of the
semester is hung on.

# 1 · Why do we need MLOps?

---

# Deterministic vs. probabilistic systems

Traditional software usually follows explicit rules.

ML systems learn a function from historical data and make predictions with uncertainty.

Implications:

- the same code can produce different models with different data
- “correctness” is measured statistically, not absolutely
- operational quality depends on both software and data quality

---

# DevOps solved a different problem

Classic DevOps is optimized for deterministic applications:

- source code is the main changing artifact
- builds produce stable binaries or containers
- automated tests validate expected behavior
- production health is often visible through latency, errors, and uptime

That foundation is still useful, but it is not enough for ML systems.

---

# Why MLOps became necessary

Traditional software teams ship code.

ML teams ship **code, data assumptions, and learned model parameters**.

That creates new operational questions:

- Which dataset produced this model?
- Can we reproduce the same result tomorrow?
- What happens when the real-world input distribution changes?
- How do we test a probabilistic system that may degrade silently?

---

# Why classic DevOps is insufficient for ML

| Traditional DevOps | MLOps |
| --- | --- |
| Main artifact: code | Main artifacts: code, data, models |
| Behavior changes mostly after code changes | Behavior can change after code, data, or retraining |
| Unit and integration tests dominate | Statistical validation and data checks become essential |
| Failures are often explicit | Failures are often silent quality drops |
| Rollback is mostly binary replacement | Rollback may require model, feature, and data coordination |

---

# The triad of change

Three moving parts shape an ML system:

1. **Code** — feature logic, training logic, serving logic
2. **Data** — training snapshots, labels, schemas, distributions
3. **Model state** — learned weights or parameters

A change in any one of them can change system behavior.

# The same model, two different jobs

| | **Research** | **Production** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Objectives** | model performance on a benchmark | different stakeholders want different things |
| **Computational priority** | fast training, high throughput | fast **inference**, low latency |
| **Data** | static, clean, historical | messy, shifting, historical + streaming |
| **Fairness** | "good to have" | must be considered |
| **Interpretability** | "good to have" | must be considered |

# Fairness and interpretability stop being optional

- **In research** they are a section you add if a reviewer asks for one
- **In production** somebody is on the receiving end of every prediction — and they can
  ask *why*
- A model that cannot be explained cannot be **appealed**, **audited**, or **defended**
- Neither can be added at the end

Suppose you have cancer and you have to choose between a black box AI surgeon that cannot
explain how it works but has a 90% cure rate, and a human surgeon with an 80% cure rate.

Then the follow-up that matters: what would you need to see to change your vote? That is
an interpretability requirement, and it can be written into a spec.

# Traditional software: separate the concerns

<div class="big-idea">Code and data are <b>separate</b>.</div>

- The input does not change the program
- You test the code; the data is somebody else's problem
- A version is a commit; a rollback is a redeploy of that commit

# ML systems: the coupling is the problem

<div class="big-idea">Code and data are <b>tightly coupled</b>. An ML system is part code, part data.</div>

So you have to version and test **both** — and the data half is the hard part:

<div class="two-col">
<div>

### Versioning data
- line-by-line diffs do not work on a dataset
- you cannot naively keep N copies of 50 GB
- what does "merge" even mean?

</div>
<div>

### Testing data
- is it correct? does it meet the model's assumptions?
- has the distribution moved — and by how much?
- not all rows are equal (cyclists on road images)
- bad rows are an **attack surface**

</div>
</div>

# What an ML solution actually is

> Machine learning is an approach to **(1) learn** **(2) complex patterns** from
> **(3) existing data** and use these patterns to make **(4) predictions** on
> **(5) unseen data**.

Five conditions:

| | **Fails when** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Learn** — the system can learn | the relationship must be stated by hand |
| **Complex patterns** — and they exist | a lookup table would do |
| **Existing data** — available, or collectable | you have no data and no way to get it |
| **Predictions** — it is a predictive problem | you need an exact answer, not an estimate |
| **Unseen data** — shares patterns with training | tomorrow does not look like yesterday |

gets cheaper.

# Apply it to your own project

Before Week 2, check your chosen topic against the list:

1. Is there a **pattern**, and is it complex enough that you cannot write it by hand?
2. Do you **have the data** — or a realistic way to collect it?
3. Is the answer a **prediction**, not an exact computation?
4. Will next month's data **look like** this month's? If not, say so now.
5. What is the **cost of a wrong answer**, and who pays it?
6. What is the **non-ML baseline** you will have to beat?

If you cannot answer 6, you do not yet have a project — you have a dataset. -->

- Deploy: you ship a model whose behaviour nobody fully specified
- Operate / Monitor: the thing degrades while running perfectly

input, which is a feedback path a normal service does not have.

# 7 · The three pillars

# Pillar 1: Reproducibility

Reproducibility means a team can explain and recreate a result.

Questions reproducible teams can answer:

# Reproducibility in practice

Core habits:

- version code with Git
- isolate environments with tools such as `uv`
- containerize runtime dependencies with Docker
- externalize configuration using `.env` files or typed settings
- record metrics, parameters, and artifacts in experiment tracking systems

---

# Pillar 2: Scalability

Scalability is not only about traffic.

In MLOps it also includes the ability to scale:

- from one developer to a team
- from one experiment to many runs
- from one model to multiple versions
- from local execution to automated pipelines
- from small datasets to large, evolving data assets

---

# Scalability concerns across the lifecycle

| Stage | Typical scaling concern |
| --- | --- |
| Development | standard project structure and reusable tooling |
| Training | larger datasets, longer runtimes, more experiments |
| Deployment | latency, throughput, resource isolation |
| Operations | multiple model versions, observability, governance |

Teams that scale well reduce manual steps and hidden dependencies.

---

# Pillar 3: Automation

Automation reduces fragile manual work.

Examples:

- automated dependency setup
- automated tests and linting
- automated training and evaluation workflows
- automated container builds
- automated deployment gates
- automated alerts for service or model degradation

---

# Automation does not remove engineering judgment

Automation should support, not replace, decisions.

Teams still need humans to define:

- success metrics
- acceptance thresholds
- rollback conditions
- ownership boundaries
- incident response processes

Bad automation scales mistakes faster.

# Who is around the loop

An ML system in production touches far more people than the "ML" job titles.

| Role | Owns |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Product owner / business** | the objective and the go/no-go |
| **Domain expert** | what the data *means*, which errors cost |
| **Data engineer** | pipelines, schemas, freshness |
| **Data scientist** | framing, experiments, offline evaluation |
| **ML engineer** | training and inference code that runs unattended |
| **MLOps / platform** | CI/CD, registry, rollout, observability |

<style>
table { font-size: 0.78rem; }
table td, table th { padding: 0.22rem 0.5rem; }
</style>

<!--
Do not read the table. Pick three rows and ask who in the room expects to be that person.

This course trains the engineering middle — ML engineer and MLOps engineer — but the rows
above and below it are where the decisions engineering cannot make actually live.
-->

# ...and the rest of the cast

| Role | Owns |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Software / backend engineer** | the product the model is embedded in |
| **SRE / on-call** | availability, incident response, the pager |
| **Security & privacy** | access, PII, retention, supply chain |
| **Legal / compliance / risk** | documentation, auditability, regulatory duty |
| **QA / test** | acceptance testing, release evidence |
| **End users / operators** | the decisions the output feeds |

In a small team **one person holds five of these rows...**

<style>
table { font-size: 0.78rem; }
table td, table th { padding: 0.22rem 0.5rem; }
</style>

<!--
The last line is the one that matters for a student heading into a startup: they will *be*
the security row and the QA row, whether or not anybody says so.

Weeks 6 and 13 deliberately touch the product-owner, domain-expert and compliance rows —
fairness slices, the model card, the kill switch. Flag that now so it does not look like
scope creep later.

# 9 · The toolchain

# Tooling overview: Git

Git matters because it gives teams:

- versioned history of source code
- collaboration through branches and pull requests
- traceability between changes and outcomes
- the baseline coordination layer for later CI workflows

For ML, Git is necessary but not sufficient because data and model artifacts often exceed normal source-control patterns.

---

# Tooling overview: Docker

Docker helps teams create repeatable runtimes.

Benefits:

- reduces “works on my machine” failures
- aligns local, CI, and deployment environments
- packages system-level dependencies cleanly
- creates a stable base for later training and serving workflows

Week 1 uses Docker as a runtime foundation, not yet as a complex platform.

---

# Tooling overview: MLflow

MLflow introduces structure around experimentation.

Typical uses:

- log parameters
- log metrics
- save artifacts
- compare runs
- register and promote model versions

Later weeks build on this to connect experimentation with team-level governance.

---

# Tooling overview: CI/CD

CI/CD extends good local practice into shared automation.

CI examples:

- run tests on every pull request
- verify training code still works
- check evaluation thresholds

CD examples:

- build containers
- publish validated artifacts
- promote approved models or services

# Typical anti-patterns in early ML projects

Watch for:

- notebooks as the only source of truth
- hidden manual preprocessing steps
- local paths hard-coded into training scripts
- dependencies installed ad hoc without pinning
- no shared definition of metrics or acceptance criteria
- no separation between secrets and code -->

<!-- ---

# Configuration management basics

Week 1 starts with a simple pattern:

- keep defaults in code
- override environment-specific values via `.env`
- commit `.env.example`, never real secrets
- document required variables clearly

This is a lightweight entry point into more robust configuration systems used later. -->

# Today's lab: train the semester's model

You will train a **diabetes prediction model** on real diagnostic data from 768 patients — the exact pipeline this course will version, validate, deploy, and monitor until Week 14.

1. Clone the repository, create a reproducible environment with `uv`
2. Run the baseline training pipeline and verify you get **identical metrics to everyone else**
3. Then change one number — the random seed — and watch accuracy move by ~5 points

> Same code. Same data file. Different model.

> That experiment *is* the triad of change — and it is why "it works on my machine" is a much stranger claim in ML than in classic software. -->
