This is the administrative half hour.
The deck is published, so nobody needs to copy dates off the screen.

Three things:
(1) the odd/even rhythm of the weeks
(2) the requirement thresholds;
(3) the setup checklist.

# What this course is not

- **Not a machine-learning course** — the model is deliberately trivial
- **Not a microservices course** — we use exactly as much as serving one model requires
- **Not a cloud course** — everything runs on your laptop; no accounts, no credit card

<br>

# What it **is**
- the practices that keep an ML system alive in production,
- and the judgement to know which of them a given project is worth.

# 2 · Semester structure

# 

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">
<div>

### Odd weeks (1, 3, 5, ...)
**In person.**

- **Monday** — practice-oriented lecture
- **Wednesday** — lab

</div>
<div>

### Even weeks (2, 4, 6, ...)
**Online / at home, asynchronous.**

- Read the short theory summary (`docs/notes/`)
- Complete the lab on your own
- Submit it for evaluation

</div>
</div>

<br>

**Both kinds of labs count the same.**



<!--

# Timing and location

| | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monday** | Lecture | 12:15–14:00 | IB111 |
| **Wednesday** | Lab | 12:15–14:00 | IL108 |

<br>

### Would you rather start at **12:30** and get a longer lunch break?

<!--
Both days should start at the same time, all semester.
-->

# Lab attendance requirement

| Labs held | You need |
| :--- | :--- |
| 13 | 10 |
| 12 | 9 |
| 11 | 8 |

**This semester:** You need to complete **9 out of 12** labs (—1 lab due to TDK on 18 Nov).

**Missed or failed labs cannot be made up.**

<!--

# 4 · Homework

---

# One project, five assignments

- By **week 4** you choose a dataset and a prediction task and get it approved
- Every homework applies that week's lab **to your own project**
- You grow **one repository** across HW1–HW5, from the provided project template
- Worked independently, project-style, with **optional consultation**

<!--
Push them towards a tabular, supervised, medium-sized dataset.
Discourage images, text and anything needing a GPU.
-->

# Homework dates

| | Out | Due |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project topic selection** | W1 · 7 Sep | **W3** · Sun 27 Sep |
| **HW1** data versioning + tracking | W5 · 5 Oct | **W8** · Sun 1 Nov |
| **HW2** validation + evaluation gates | W7 · 19 Oct | **W10** · Sun 15 Nov |
| **HW3** orchestration | W9 · 2 Nov | **W12** · Sun 29 Nov |
| **HW4** serving + rollout | W11 · 16 Nov | **W13** · Sun 6 Dec |
| **HW5** observability + drift | W13 · 30 Nov | **W14** · Sun 13 Dec |

Three to four weeks each.

Deadlines are **Sunday 23:59**, via your project repository.

<!--
Confirm the deadline day with the group — Sunday night is the default but some cohorts prefer Friday so the weekend is genuinely free.

Late policy: state your own.
The official requirements allow exactly one homework to be made up in the retake week; anything softer than that during the semester is your call and should be announced now.

| **85–100%** | 5 — excellent *(jeles)* |

# Retakes

| Component | Can it be repeated? |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lab** | **No** |
| **Homework** | **One** of the five, during the retake week |
| **ZH** | Once, during the retake week. **No second retake.** |

<!--

# ZH

- **Week 11-14**
- Covering lecture material from **all previous weeks**
- Written
- You will be asked *why* a mechanism is needed, what it costs, and what it fails to catch

<br>

### Exact date, room and format to be confirmed in the first weeks.

# Using AI assistants

**Permitted with one condition:** you must understand and be able to explain **every artifact you
submit**.

You may be asked to explain your submission, in person.


<!--
Frame this as professional practice rather than as a concession. In a real team you are
accountable for what you merge regardless of who or what typed it.

If you plan spot-check conversations on homework, announce that now.

# 6 · Prerequisites and setup

---

# What you are assumed to know

**Required**

- Solid general programming skills
- Git basics (clone, branch, commit, push, PR)
- Python knowledge and experience with its ecosystem (virtual environments, pytest)
- Understanding of machine-learning concepts (data processing, model training, evaluation)

**Not assumed at all**

- Any of the tools we use (Docker, MLflow, DVC, etc.)
- DevOps practices (CI/CD, orchestration, monitoring)

<!--
-->

---

# What you need on your laptop

**Hardware:** 16 GB RAM. Later weeks run several services at once.

| Tool | Needed from | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Git | Week 1 | git-scm.com |
| GitHub | Week 1 | github.com |
| uv (Python package manager) | Week 1 | docs.astral.sh/uv |
| Docker Desktop / Engine + Compose | Week 2 | docs.docker.com/get-docker |
| kind | Week 9 | kind.sigs.k8s.io |
| kubectl | Week 9 | kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools |

<!--
On Windows, strongly recommend WSL2 plus Docker Desktop's WSL backend.

Tell them to check free disk space now: the images across the semester add up to roughly
10 GB, and week 10 alone pulls ~2.5 GB.
-->

---

# Before Wednesday

```bash
# 1. Verify the toolchain
git --version
uv --version
docker --version && docker compose version

# 2. Get the course repository
git clone https://vihibxav054-00.github.io/mlops-course && cd mlops-course

# 3. Run the week 1 lab from a clean clone
cd labs/week-01-env-setup/starter
uv sync --locked
uv run --frozen pytest -v
```

<!--
Common causes, in order: no Docker Desktop running, corporate proxy blocking the package
index, an old uv, and a clone inside OneDrive/iCloud.
-->

# Where everything lives

| What | Where |
| :--- | :--- |
| The 14-week plan and assessment | `docs/syllabus.md` |
| Short theory summary per week (**your even-week reading**) | `docs/notes/week-XX-notes.md` |
| Lecture slides | published site · `lectures/week-XX-*/` |
| The lab you work in | `labs/week-XX-*/starter/` |
| Homework briefs | `homework/hw-XX-*/README.md` |
| Datasets and the topic catalogue | `datasets/` |
| Reading map — books, courses, papers, per week | `docs/resources.md` |
| ZH revision guide | `docs/exam-revision.md` |

<!--
Fill in the actual channels before the first class: repository URL, the slides site, and
where announcements go (Teams / Moodle / Neptun). Say which one is authoritative for
deadlines — one channel, not three.
